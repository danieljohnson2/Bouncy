# Bouncy
My first Godot project!

A simple game; you control one of several bounding balls using the arrow keys,
and try to avoid all other balls as long as you can. The other balls move a
bit erratically, and speed up over time.

The arrows move your ball; space to stop, hold shift to increase your
acceleration. Q quits, and R restarts after you die.
